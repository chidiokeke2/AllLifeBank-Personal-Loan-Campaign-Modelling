# AllLifeBank-Personal-Loan-Campaign-Modelling
AllLife Bank is a US bank that has a growing customer base. The majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying sizes of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors).AllLifeBank dataset was used to build a model that will help the marketing department to identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing a loan product.

I utiiized supervise learning techniques to solve this classification problem to predict whether a liability customer will buy a personal loan or not. I also uncovered insights on which segment of customers should be targeted more and which variables are most significant.
